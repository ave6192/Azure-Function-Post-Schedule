# Azure-Function-Post-Schedule


Description of Work
Looking for an azure function developer to support with a "small" function and its documentation.

Objective:
- Get search job results from " https://www.mottmac.com/careers/search " and identify those containing "digital" , store them in a SQL database, and expose the offers over the last 3 months in an excel file to be downloaded.
- Azure function to be written in python
- User stories:
- I want to be able to download the latest (over last 3 months) data information.
- Ideally, I can connect a powerbi dashboard to the SQL database (storing all the information).

Along with this, I would expect a documentation on how, from an existing resource group, to deploy the function, databases, and blob storage.
